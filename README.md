# MURKFLIX

## Description:

It is a kind of Netflix clone (not with all the features) with a little personal touch and a database created by myself.
The idea was to make a full stack MERN project, where you can see the data treatment from the backend as well as the implementation and the way to show it from the frontend. I also wanted to update and strengthen my knowledge of CRUD operations, authentication with JWT, React-router-dom and Hooks.
